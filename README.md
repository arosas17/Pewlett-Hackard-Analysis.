# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Goals and Findings

Through this data, it is determined that 70,000 employees will be retiring over a four year period with about 50,000 being Senior Engineers and Senior Staff but only about 1,550 employees ready for the mentorship program to replace the retiring employees.

## Summary
Looking at the tables above, we determine little over 70,000 employees will be retiring soon over the course of four years (this is an estimate base on the birth years used to decide who would be retireing). Assuming that the employees retire at approxamately the same rate over the course of the years, the company would be looking to replace about 17,500 retiring employees per year. This is a rather large amount of employees that will be retiring. However, looking into the mentorship elegibility, it is discoraging to see that there are only about 1,549 employees that would meet the crateria for the mentorship program. This leaves a massive diffrence between the retirees and the possible replacements. 


In addition to this, comes some uncertainty of how each department would be affected with the upcoming retirements. In the table below, titled "Retiring Titles per Department," shows a table presenting the count of titles that will be retiring and their respective department, with a smaller table alongside it showing the department numbers and their names. From this table, it is determined that department numbers 4 and 5 (production and development) will be the two departments that will be most affected, considering they contain the most engineers/Senior engineers, some of the top titles for the retirement in the company in the nearing future. Another one that is concerning is department number 7 (Sales), where a lot of the employees are Senior Staff are retiring as well. With all this considered, the company show focus their efforts on obtaining employees for departments: production, development, and sales.


To add on to this information, a table is shown below titled "Mentorship Eligibility Titles", presenting the count of titles within the mentorship eleigible employees. This spread tells that the count is similar to the reirement title count in a sense that staff and engineer positions have the biggest title count but in diffrent orders compared to senior and mid level positions. It also shows that the biggest diffrence in retiree titles and mentorship titles are with engineering and staff positions, showing that the retiring titles of techniques leaders, assistant engineers, and managers are in less critical states.
